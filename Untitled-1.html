	<p>&nbsp; Commentï¼š The AI writer is good whe it can create story, but it feel weird.</p>
<p>Philip had always loved deserted Shanghai with its defeated, delicious ditches. It was a place where she felt calm. She was an articulate, optimistic, beer drinker with red fingers and solid toes. Her friends saw her as a faint, few friend. Once, she had even helped a brave blind person cross the road. That's the sort of woman he was. Philip walked over to the window and reflected on her chilly surroundings. The sleet rained like drinking dogs. Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of David . David was a hungry do gooder with handsome fingers and fluffy toes. Philip gulped. She was not prepared for David. As Philip stepped outside and David came closer, she could see the shaggy glint in his eye. David gazed with the affection of 7347 spiteful homeless hamsters. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want some more Facebook friends." Philip looked back, even more sleepy and still fingering the crumpled rock. "David, what's up Doc," she replied. They looked at each other with shocked feelings, like two screeching, smoked snakes loving at a very rude birthday party, which had piano music playing in the background and two popular uncles partying to the beat. Philip regarded David's handsome fingers and fluffy toes. "I feel the same way!" revealed Philip with a delighted grin. David looked worried, his emotions blushing like a hot, huge hat. Then David came inside for a nice drink of beer.&nbsp;</p>
